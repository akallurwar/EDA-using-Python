# HR Analytics_Attrition

![](images/HR-Analytics.jpg)

This data set presents an employee survey from IBM, indicating if there is attrition or not. The data set contains approximately 1500 entries.
As a future development, with a sufficiently large data set, it would be used to run a segmentation on employees, to develop certain “at risk” categories of employees. This could generate new insights for the business on what drives attrition, insights that cannot be generated by merely informational interviews with employees.
