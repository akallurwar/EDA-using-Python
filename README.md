## Exploratory data analysis using Python

__Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)__ includes __cleaning__, __munging__, __combining__, __reshaping__, __slicing__, __dicing__, and __transforming data__ for analysis purpose.

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis
 
Understand the data by EDA and derive simple models with Pandas as baseline.

EDA ia a critical and first step in analyzing the data and we do this for below reasons :

    - Finding patterns in Data
    
    - Determining relationships in Data
    
    - Checking of assumptions
    
    - Preliminary selection of appropriate models
    
    - Detection of mistakes 

## Repository Overview

This repository is about Exploratory data analysis as per the industry practices.

* The objective of this analysis is to get insights from the data whether the patient will survive after 5 years or not based upon the patientâ€™s age, year of operation and the number of positive axillary nodes.
