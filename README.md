## Exploratory data analysis using Python

__Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)__ includes __cleaning__, __munging__, __combining__, __reshaping__, __slicing__, __dicing__, and __transforming data__ for analysis purpose.

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis
 
Understand the data by EDA and derive simple models with Pandas as baseline.

EDA ia a critical and first step in analyzing the data and we do this for below reasons :

    - Finding patterns in Data
    
    - Determining relationships in Data
    
    - Checking of assumptions
    
    - Preliminary selection of appropriate models
    
    - Detection of mistakes 

## Repository Overview

This repository is about Exploratory data analysis as per the industry practices.

* Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses, irrespective of geography, industry and size of the company. Employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. As such, there is great business interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition.
