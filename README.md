 #### Exploratory Data Analysis
 
Understand the data by EDA and derive simple models with Pandas as baseline.

EDA ia a critical and first step in analyzing the data and we do this for below reasons :

    - Finding patterns in Data
    
    - Determining relationships in Data
    
    - Checking of assumptions
    
    - Preliminary selection of appropriate models
    
    - Detection of mistakes
